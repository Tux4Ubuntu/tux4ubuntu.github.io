Tux likes his games! Here’s his favorite games such as Warmux, TuxKart, SuperTux and more (all conveniently featuring him of course).

## Use the Installer
Use the Tux4Ubuntu-installer by highlighting and copying (__Ctrl + C__) and open the terminal (__Ctrl + Alt + T__) and paste (__Ctrl + Shift + V__) the following line of code and press Enter:

~~~~~
sudo apt -y install curl && bash <(curl -Ls https://github.com/Tux4Ubuntu/tux-install/raw/master/install.sh)
~~~~~

## Got Stuck? Other Linux Distribution? Keep on reading
This installation process is only gonna cover the “sudo apt install packagename” process. If you’re distribution doesn’t support it we link to each of the games installation guides. But we’re all thankfull if you comment how you solved it.
